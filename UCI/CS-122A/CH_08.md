## Part 2 Database Design

### Chapter 8 Relational Database Design


#### 8.1 Features of Good Relational Designs
-  **functional dependency**
   -  “each specific value for *dept name* corresponds to at most one *budget*"
   -  $dept\_name \rightarrow budget$
-  **lossy decompositions**
   -  Split but may have duplicated values
      -  *employee (ID, name, street, city, salary)*
         -  employee1 (ID, name)
         - employee2 (name, street, city, salary)
      -  *name* many Kims with differetn id 
   - Not all decompositions of schemas are helpful
-  those that are not as **lossless decomposition**


#### 8.2 Atomic Domains and First Normal Form
- A **domain** is **atomic** if elements of the domain are considered to be ***indivisible units***
  - A set of names is an example of a nonatomic value (first name, last name)
- **1NF**
  - We say that a relation schema R is in first normal form (1NF) if
**the domains of all attributes of R are atomic.**
- The use of set-valued attributes can lead to designs with **redundant storage of data**, which in turn can result in **inconsistencies**.
  -  Failure to perform both updates can leave the database in an inconsistent state 

#### 8.3 Decomposition Using Functional Dependencies
- Greek letters for sets of attributes $\alpha$
-  a **lowercase** Roman letter followed by an **uppercase** Roman letter in parentheses to refer to a **relation schema** $r(R)$
-  When a set of attributes is a **superkey**, we denote it by $K$
   -  superkey 就是含有primary key的集合
- When it is clear that **we are talking about an instance**, we may use simply **the relation name** $r$

##### 8.3.1 Keys and Functional Dependencies
- **legal instance**
  - There are usually a variety of constraints (rules) on the data in the real world.
  - An instance of a relation that satisfies all real-world constraints is called **a legal instance** of the relation; 
- Some of the most commonly used types of real-world constraints can be represented formally as keys (superkeys, candidate keys and primary keys), or as functional dependencies, which we define below
- we restate that definition here as follows:
  - Let $r(R)$ be a relation schema.
  - A subset $K$ of $R$ is a ***superkey*** of $r(R)$ if, in any legal instance of r(R), for all pairs $t_1$ and $t_2$ of tuples in the instance of r if $t_1\neq t_2$, then $t_1[K] \neq t_2[K]$
  - Consider a relation schema $r(R)$, and let $\alpha ⊆ R$ and $\beta ⊆ R$.
    - Given an instance of r(R), we say that the instance satisfies the **functional dependency** $\alpha → \beta$ if for *all pairs* of tuples $t_1$ and $t_2$ in the instance such that $t_1[\alpha] = t_2[\alpha]$, it is also the case that $t_1[\beta] = t_2[\beta]$
    - we say the **functional dependency** $\alpha → \beta$ **holds on schema** $r(R)$ if, in *every legal instance* of $r(R)$ it satisfies the functional dependency
    - Using the **functional-dependency notation**, we say that $K$ is a **superkey** of $r(R)$ if the functional dependency $K → R$ holds on $r(R)$
  - Functional dependencies allow us to express constraints that we cannot express with superkeys
- We shall use functional dependencies in two ways:
  1. To test instances of relations to see whether they satisfy a given set $F$ of functional dependencies
  2. To specify constraints on the set of legal relations.
     1. only concerns those relation instances that satisfy **a given set of functional dependencies**.
- Some functional dependencies are said to be **trivial** because they are satisfied by all relations : $A\rightarrow A$
  - In general, a functional dependency of the form $\alpha → \beta$ is **trivial** if $\beta ⊆ \alpha$
- an instance of a relation **may satisfy** some functional dependencies that **are not required** to hold on the relation’s schema.
- $F^+$ to denote the **closure** of the set $F$
  - that is, the set of *all functional dependencies* that **can be inferred** given the set $F$.

##### 8.3.2 Boyce –Codd Normal Form BCNF
- It eliminates all redundancy that can be discovered **based on functional dependencies**
-  A **relation schema** $R$ is in **BCNF** with respect
to a set $F$ of **functional dependencies** if, for *all functional dependencies* in $F^+$ of
the form $\alpha → \beta$, where $\alpha ⊆ R$ and $\beta ⊆ R$, **at least one** of the following holds:
   - $\alpha → \beta$ is a **trivial** functional dependency (that is, $\beta ⊆ \alpha$).
   - $\alpha$ is a **superkey** for schema $R$.
- **A database design** is in **BCNF** if *each member of the set of relation schemas* that constitutes the design is in **BCNF**.
- a general rule for **decomposing** that are not in BCNF
  - Let $R$ be a schema that is **not in BCNF**
    - Then there is **at least one nontrivial functional dependency** $\alpha → \beta$ such that $\alpha$ is **not a superkey** for $R4
  - replace $R$ with 2 schemas
    - $(\alpha∪\beta)$
    - $(R-(\beta-\alpha))$
-  may be **more** of the resulting schemas are not in BCNF
   -   **further decomposition** is required, the eventual result of which is a set of BCNF schemas

##### 8.3.3 BCNF and Dependency Preservation
- an instructor can be associated with only a single department and a student may have more than one advisor, but at most one from a given department
- Because our design makes it computationally hard to enforce this functional dependency, we say our design is **not dependency preserving**
- consider another normal form, **weaker than BCNF**, that will allow us to **preserve dependencies**

###### 8.3.4 Third Normal Form 3NF
- Third normal form (3NF) allowing certain **nontrivial functional dependencies** whose left side is not a **superkey**
-  a **candidate key** is a minimal superkey— that is, a superkey no proper subset of which is also a superkey
-  A relation schema $R$ is in **third normal form** with respect to a set $F$ of functional dependencies if, for *all functional dependencies* in $F^+$ of the form $\alpha → \beta$, where $\alpha ⊆ R and \beta ⊆ R$, **at least one** of the following holds:
   -  $\alpha → \beta$ is a **trivial** functional dependency.
   -  $\alpha$ is a **superkey** for $R$
   -  Each attribute $A$ in $\beta − \alpha$ is **contained** in a **candidate** key for $R$
      -  the third condition above **does not** say that **a single candidate key** must contain all the attributes in $\beta − \alpha$; 
      -  each attribute $A$ in $\beta − \alpha$ **may be** contained in a **different** candidate key.
- any schema that satisfies BCNF also satisfies 3NF


#### 8.4 Functional-Dependency Theory

##### 8.4.1 Closure of a Set of Functional Dependencies
- given a set $F$ of functional dependencies on a schema, we can prove that certain **other functional dependencies also hold on the schema**
  - such functional dependencies are **“logically implied”** by $F$
- given a relational schema $r(R)$, a functional dependency $f$ on $R$ is **logically implied** by a set of functional dependencies $F$ on $r$ if *every instance* of $r(R)$ that satisfies $F$ also satisfies $f$ .
- The **closure** of F, denoted by $F^+$, is the set of all functional dependencies **logically implied** by $F$
- **Axioms**, or **rules of inference**, provide a simpler technique for reasoning about functional dependencies. 
  - Greek letters $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma,... )$ for **sets** of attributes
  - uppercase Roman letters for **individual attributes**
  - $\alpha \beta$ to denote $\alpha ∪ \beta$.
- **Armstrong’s axioms**
  - **Reflexivity rule**. If $\alpha$ is a *set of attributes* and $\beta ⊆ \alpha$, then $\alpha → \beta$ holds.
  - Augmentation rule. If $\alpha → \beta$ holds and $\gamma$ is a set of attributes, then $\gamma \alpha → \gamma \beta$ holds
  - **Transitivity rule**. If $\alpha → \beta$ holds and $\beta → \gamma$ holds, then $\alpha → \gamma$ holds
  - Armstrong’s axioms are **sound**, because they do **not** generate any **incorrect** functional dependencies
  - They are **complete**, because, for a given set $F$ of functional dependencies, they allow us to generate **all** $F^+$.
-  additional rules:
   -  **Union rule**. If $\alpha → \beta$ holds and $\alpha → \gamma$ holds, then $\alpha → \beta \gamma$ holds
   -  **Decomposition rule**. If $\alpha → \beta \gamma$ holds, then $\alpha → \beta$ holds and $\alpha → \gamma$ holds
   -  **Pseudotransitivity rule**. If $\alpha → \beta$ holds and $\gamma \beta → \theta$ holds, then $\alpha \gamma → \theta$ holds.

##### 8.4.2 Closure of Attribute Sets
- We say that an **attribute** $B$ is **functionally determined** by $\alpha$ if $\alpha → B$
- algo for $F^+$
```
F+ = F
repeat
  for each functional dependency f in F +
    apply Reflexivity and Augmentation on f
    add the result to F+
  for each pair of functional dependencies f1 and f2 in F +
    if f1 and f2 can be combined using transitivity
      add the result to F+
until F+ does not change any further
```
- ***closure*** 
  - Let $\alpha$ be a set of attributes. We call the set of all attributes functionally determined by $\alpha$ under a set $F$ of functional dependencies the **closure** of $\alpha$ under $F$; we denote it by $\alpha^+$
  - algo for $a^+$
    ```
    result := α;
    repeat
      for each functional dependency β → γ in F do
        begin
          if α ⊆ result
            then result := result ∪ γ;
      end
    until (result does not change)
    ```
  - There are several uses of the attribute closure algorithm:
    - To test if $\alpha$ is a **superkey**, we compute $\alpha^+$, and check if $\alpha^+$ contains all attributes in $R$
    - check if a functional dependency $\alpha → \beta$ holds (or, in other words, is in $F^+$), by checking if $\beta ⊆ \alpha^+$.
    - an alternative way to compute $F^+$: For each $\gamma ⊆ R$, we find the **closure** $\gamma^+$, and for each $S ⊆ \gamma^+$ +, we output a functional dependency $\gamma → S$.

##### 8.4.3 Canonical Cover
- Whenever a user performs an **update** on the relation, the database system must **ensure** that the update **does not violate** any functional dependencies
- We can **reduce** the effort spent in checking for violations by testing a **simplified set** of functional dependencies that has the **same closure** as the given set
- An attribute of a functional dependency is said to be ***extraneous*** if we can **remove** it **without changing** the **closure** of the set of functional dependencies.
- **extraneous attributes**
  -  Consider a set $F$ of functional dependencies and the functional dependency $\alpha → \beta$ in $F$.
     -  Attribute $A$ is **extraneous** in $\alpha$ if $A ∈ \alpha$, and $F$ **logically implies** $(F − \{\alpha →\beta\}) ∪ \{(\alpha − A) → \beta\}$
     -  Attribute $A$ is extraneous in $\beta$ if $A ∈ \beta$, and the set of functional dependencies $(F − \{\alpha → \beta\}) ∪ \{\alpha → (\beta − A)\}$ logically implies $F$.
- algo for **canonical cover**
```
Fc = F
repeat
  Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in Fc of the form
    α1 → β1 and α1 → β2 with α1 → β1 β2.
  Find a functional dependency α → β in Fc with an extraneous attribute either in α or in β.
    /* Note: the test for extraneous attributes is done using Fc , not F */
    If an extraneous attribute is found, 
      delete it from α → β in Fc .
until (Fc does not change)
```
- A canonical cover $F_c$ for $F$ is a set of dependencies such that $F$ **logically implies all dependencies** in $F_c$ , and $F_c$ **logically implies all dependencies** in $F$
  - Furthermore, $F_c$ must have the following properties:
    - No functional dependency in $F_c$ contains an **extraneous** attribute.
    - Each **left side** of a functional dependency in $F_c$ is **unique**. That is, there are no two dependencies $\alpha1 → \beta1$ and $\alpha2 → \beta2$ in Fc such that $\alpha1 = \alpha2$.
- Given a set F of functional dependencies, it may be that an entire functional dependency in the set is extraneous, in the sense that dropping it does not change the closure of F.
- A canonical cover might not be unique.

##### 8.4.4 Lossless Decomposition
We say that the **decomposition** is a **lossless decomposition** if there is no loss of information by replacing $r(R)$ with two relation schemas $r_1(R_1)$ and $r_2(R_2)$
- $\Pi_{R_1}(r)\bowtie\Pi_{R_2}(r)=r$
- relation $r$ contains the same set of tuples as the result of the following SQL query:
```SQL
select *
from (select R1 from r)
  natural join
  (select R2 from r)
```
- A decomposition that is **not** a lossless decomposition is called a **lossy decomposition**. 
  - The terms **lossless-join decomposition** and **lossy-join decomposition** are sometimes used in place of lossless decomposition and lossy decomposition
- We can use **functional dependencies** to show when certain decompositions are lossless.
  - Let $R, R1, R2, F$ be as above. $R1$ and $R2$ form a **lossless decomposition** of R if **at least one** of the following functional dependencies is in $F^+$:
    - $R1∩R2 \rightarrow R1$
    - $R1∩R2 \rightarrow R2$
- In other words, if $R1 ∩ R2$ forms a **superkey** of either $R1$ or $R2$, the decomposition of $R$ is a lossless decomposition

##### 8.4.5 Dependency Preservation
- **restriction**
  - Let $F$ be a set of **functional dependencies** on a schema $R$, 
  - and let $R1, R2,..., Rn$ be a decomposition of $R$
  - The **restriction** of $F$ to $Ri$ is the set $Fi$ of all functional dependencies in $F^+$ that include only attributes of $R$
- Note that the definition of restriction uses all dependencies in $F^+$, **not just** those in F
- Let $F' = F1 ∪ F2 ∪ ··· ∪ Fn$
  - We say that a decomposition having the property $F'^+ = $F^+$ is a **dependency-preserving** decomposition.
- We now give a second alternative test for dependency preservation that avoids computing $F^+$
  - The test applies the following procedure to each $\alpha → \beta$ in $F$.
```
result = α
repeat
  for each Ri in the decomposition
      t = (result ∩ Ri)+ ∩ Ri
      result = result ∪ t
until (result does not change)
```
- if **result** contains **all attributes** in $\beta$, then the functional dependency $\alpha → \beta$ is preserved.
- The second idea is to use a modified form of the attribute-closure algorithm to compute closure under $F'$ , without actually first computing $F'$
- This test takes polynomial time, instead of the exponential time required to compute $F^+$
